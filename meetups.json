The target audience is SQL developers.</p> <p>We'll start with an overview of Neo4J and its query language Cypher before moving on to a few worked examples where we'll build and query the same data set using first relational databases and then Neo4J.</p> <p>We'll also cover graph modeling, query optimization and show an example of procedures which were introduced in the 3.0 version of Neo4J.</p> <p><b>What is Neo4J?</b></p> <p>Here's a good summary by Emil Eifrem, creator of Neo4J:<br/>Most applications today handle data that is deeply associative, i.e. structured as graphs (networks). The most obvious example of this is social networking sites, but even tagging systems, content management systems and wikis deal with inherently hierarchical or graph-shaped data.<br/>This turns out to be a problem because it\u2019s difficult to deal with recursive data structures in traditional relational databases. In essence, each traversal along a link in a graph is a join, and joins are known to be very expensive. Furthermore, with user-driven content, it is difficult to pre-conceive the exact schema of the data that will be handled. Unfortunately, the relational model requires upfront schemas and makes it difficult to fit this more dynamic and ad-hoc data.<br/>A graph database uses nodes, relationships between nodes and key-value properties instead of tables to represent information. This model is typically substantially faster for associative data sets and uses a schema-less, bottoms-up model that is ideal for capturing ad-hoc and rapidly changing data.</p> ",

Where we don\u2019t just offer a single monolithic platform, we offer a multidimensional approach where users can pick and choose the workflows and micro apps of their choice.</p> <p>A similar trend is also happening in software development, where microservices are now the mainstream approach for scalable systems architecture. Many software engineers are making the transition from monolithic architectures to microservice architectures. This approach has until most recently been limited to back-end services. As development is much more complicated when using microservices as building blocks for a frontend solutions, especially with the latest JS frameworks that promote a\u00a0monolithic approach to front-end architecture.</p> <p>We will give an overview of the theory of microservices \u2013 what they are and why you would use them. We will then delve into the dark arts of back-end development, explaining how you can construct a winning product with microservices whilst avoiding its pitfalls. We will also discuss methods of rolling your own Frontend app in a world of backend microservices and tackling the challenges of monolithic frontend apps when working with microservices as backend.<br/>\u00a0\nThe presentation will cover:</p> <p>\u2022 Background on what microservices are and why you would use them</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A walk through of a backend application development and architecture using microservices to compare and contrast\u00a0 traditional architectural methodologies</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A discuss on the ways of rolling your own frontend app in a world of backend microservices and ways of tackling challenges of having a monolithic frontend app working with microservices as backend</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, no discussion of microservices would be complete without touching on the integration of Docker and Kubernetes from a developer\u2019s perspective<br/>\u00a0</p> <p><b>Speakers:</b></p> <p><b>Oliver Butterfield (Platform Lead)</b> is <a href=\"https://complyadvantage.com/\">ComplyAdvantage\u2019</a>s primary driving towards adopting a microservice architecture. Oliver previously worked in the server hosting industry and as one of the first team members became the de facto DevOps Engineer in the early days of ComplyAdvantage. Fast forward three years and he's now overseeing development of our client-facing services, including the refactoring of the core application from a monolith to microservices. Oliver is currently excited by distributed computing and performance technologies, such as Kubernetes, AWS, NewRelic and Go.</p> <p><b>Persic Alexandru Cristian (Backend Lead)</b> studied computer science at \"Stefan cel Mare\" University, followed by a masters degree in software engineering (apparently 5 years of study was not good enough). At University he started working at an outsource company using Microsoft technologies and enjoyed each step from helping with JavaScript to implementing custom workflows in SharePoint. After 5 years he saw the light and moved to Python/Django, building a mobile advertising platform from the ground up. In 4 years he managed to gain plenty of experience in managing the implementation, deployment, and maintenance of a large scale web application. In 2016 Cristi made a daring move and joined <a href=\"https://complyadvantage.com/\">ComplyAdvantage</a> in the quest of finding once more the excitement of building a new and successful product, all the while fighting crime like any other regular superhero.<br/>\u00a0\n<b>Kun Andrei (FrontEnd Lead)</b> graduated from Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, studying Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology. Since then he's been working as a Web Developer on both backend and frontend, though finally focussing on the latter. He followed his passion for UI and the latest frontend technologies. After he gained experience with various corporations and outsourcing companies he was lured by the opportunities of a young and ambitious startup team where he could take ownership of his work and put his own mark on products. Joining <a href=\"https://complyadvantage.com/\">ComplyAdvantage</a> was the right step in this direction, he now takes care of the company's front-end apps.<br/>\u00a0\n<b>Andrew Smith (DevOps Lead)</b> studied Mathematics at Warwick University (UK). Graduating in 2012 with no idea what he wanted to do as a career, he fell into a Release Engineering Role at a London FinTech company. Three years later, in January 2016, he joined <a href=\"https://complyadvantage.com/\">ComplyAdvantage</a> as their first DevOps Engineer (a far more morally fulfilling role). He has implemented technology, infrastructure, and procedures to effectively and reliably go \"From Idea to Production\" (to quote GitLab) and to keep everything highly available once it's there. Outside of work, you'll most likely find him at the nearest venue playing loud music, performing culinary experimentation or creating fine works of art in MS Paint.</p> <p><b>Schedule:\u00a0</b></p> <p>18:00 - 18:15 - Arrival time.

Typically those libraries provide default instances for \"standard\" types and various ways of combining them. Library users must write instances for their own data types in terms of those.\u00a0</p> <p>This is usually a time consuming and laborious process, but it is nevertheless completely mechanical, based entirely on the structure of the types involved. So wouldn't it be nice if we could persuade the Scala compiler to use the structure of those types and do the work for us?\u00a0Building on [shapeless's](<a href=\"https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/)\u00a0core\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/)\u00a0core</a> generic programming primitives and support for automatic type class derivation we can!</p> <p>In this talk we'll see how taking advantage of automatic derivation reduces boilerplate &amp; mechanical code.

Start date is 14th of February.</p> <p>Arthur Kerpician and\u00a0 Radu Mazilu have prepared for our community\u00a0one hour talk, \"From zero to (almost) hero - how to build a commercial product in your own time\". \u00a0They have build scrumvee.com product and they want to share their experience with us:\u00a0</p> <p><i>We knew from the first hours of eMAG's Mobile Edition Hackathon 2015, that we got ourselves hooked on this project and we won't escape it anytime soon. One year passed, dozens of weekends and evenings burned coding and here we are: providing all fellow developers a Scrum tool that would make the Agile experience trackable, accurate and more fun. And it's free for all!</i></p> <p><i>During the one hour meet-up, we'll walk you through the core concepts used in our product, how it evolved from spaghetti to a fancy looking dinner, technologies of choice, milestones and future developments waiting to be tackled. A demo involving you, our end-user, will showcase all the features and advantages of our product. Whoever survives the demo, will be granted access to our pizza and beer cave ;)</i></p> <p><br/>After 11 years of entrepreneurship, Arthur joined the eMAG team, where he performed as a software developer and a team manager.\u00a0Arthur's working now for two start-ups, co-owning one of them and doing the most enjoyable things: trying and catching.</p> <p>After working on personal projects and doing freelance gigs for over 6 years, Radu is now working during the day as a software developer at eMAG and as an Android developer at night. He's really annoyed by waiting ridiculous amounts of time for a page to load, so he's also known as \"The Query Slayer\".</p> <p><br/>Agenda:</p> <p>18:45 - 19:00 Arriving, socializing<br/>19:00 - 19:10 Introduction<br/>19:10 - 20:00 TBD\u00a0<br/>20:00 - 20:15 Break<br/>20:15- 21:00 Open Space - ask the speakers for more details or propose interesting topics<br/>21:00 - 21:10 Closing</p> <p>See you on 14th February!</p> ",
