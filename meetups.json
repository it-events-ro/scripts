        "description": "<p>Hello friends,</p> <p>We're excited to announce our first event of the year and it's going to be a bit different than what we've done before. We're trying out a new concept and we hope it'll catch on :)</p> <p>Together with our friends at JSHacks we're kicking off a series of events called JSHacks Sessions. The main idea is to host small-scale events (15-20 participants) and discuss\u00a0to-the-point JavaScript topics in a presentation/workshop/discussion fashion in a super friendly and cozy atmosphere. Hosts of the events will likely be competent\u00a0professionals in the to-be-discussed topic and will gladly share\u00a0their experience.\u00a0If you can't make it to this event, don't worry. We're likely to make as many as we can,\u00a0also taking into consideration feedback/demand/popularity.</p> <p>For the first event in the series, we're tackling ES6 (or ES2015 or ESNext) with a walk through all the changes and new features that will take JavaScript development to a whole new level. Among others, we'll discuss block scoping variables, arrow functions, classes, enhanced objects, iterators, generators and a bunch more. The session is aimed at those who worked with ES5 but haven't had a lot of opportunities to play around with ES6 and want to learn more about it's potential. Concepts won't be covered in too much depth (each topic\u00a0could easily deserve its own session), mostly due to time limitations. But it'll give you a first impression of the power using ES6 unleashes.</p> <p>Your host will be Andrei\u00a0Antal, co-organizer for Angular Bucharest Meetup, co-member in the JSHacks community and JavaScript technologies enthusiast.</p> <p>Although the main focus will be a presentation of the concepts (with occasional side discussions) some\u00a0plunks\u00a0will be provided so you can try out the examples for yourself. You're welcomed to bring your laptops (only a functional browser is required).</p> <p><br/>NOTE: \u00a0<b>A small fee of 4euros will be charged for your participation.</b> Due to very limited attendance\u00a0space, we kindly ask that you apply only if you know that you can attend. <b>No refunds are possible.</b></p> <p>Hope to see you there and let this be the start of an exciting series of events in our awesome community!</p> <p>Have a productive day,</p> <p>AngulaJS Bucharest and JSHacks team</p> ",

The target audience is SQL developers.</p> <p>We'll start with an overview of Neo4J and its query language Cypher before moving on to a few worked examples where we'll build and query the same data set using first relational databases and then Neo4J.</p> <p>We'll also cover graph modeling, query optimization and show an example of procedures which were introduced in the 3.0 version of Neo4J.</p> <p><b>What is Neo4J?</b></p> <p>Here's a good summary by Emil Eifrem, creator of Neo4J:<br/>Most applications today handle data that is deeply associative, i.e. structured as graphs (networks). The most obvious example of this is social networking sites, but even tagging systems, content management systems and wikis deal with inherently hierarchical or graph-shaped data.<br/>This turns out to be a problem because it\u2019s difficult to deal with recursive data structures in traditional relational databases. In essence, each traversal along a link in a graph is a join, and joins are known to be very expensive. Furthermore, with user-driven content, it is difficult to pre-conceive the exact schema of the data that will be handled. Unfortunately, the relational model requires upfront schemas and makes it difficult to fit this more dynamic and ad-hoc data.<br/>A graph database uses nodes, relationships between nodes and key-value properties instead of tables to represent information. This model is typically substantially faster for associative data sets and uses a schema-less, bottoms-up model that is ideal for capturing ad-hoc and rapidly changing data.</p> ",

During this presentation, he aims to cover the following:</p> <p><i>What is software testing? It is simply understanding the functionality and architecture of </i><i>a piece of software and test it until fear of not finding any bugs turns to boredom? But w</i><i>ha</i><i>t about</i><i> coding? Is that required for a tester or it is a knowledge exclu</i><i>sively for developers? Does coding help in the software testing? Is automation a fantasy, in a euphoric world? The difference between software delivering and software developing / testing is a topic which can be discussed until the edge of infinity. The pros and cons of each side will be discussed from a QA point of view.</i></p> <p>Levi started to learn, after few years he was asked to tutor, teach and train others in the magical land of automation and testing.

Some of these are true, but freelancers also deal with risk, late payments, difficult clients, uncomfortable timezones, distributed teams and more. It takes discipline, very good communication skills, some sales &amp; marketing techniques and top notch technical know-how to make it as a successful freelancer.</p> <p>To kick off the discussion we invited Tudor Fis to tell us about his experience as a freelancer. He has been working since 2009 for various clients in Europe and the US. If you are thinking about freelancing or you are already an experience freelancer we\u2019d love to meet you. It will be an open discussion. Looking forward to your questions!</p> ",

Some of these are true, but freelancers also deal with risk, late payments, difficult clients, uncomfortable timezones, distributed teams and more. It takes discipline, very good communication skills, some sales &amp; marketing techniques and top notch technical know-how to make it as a successful freelancer.</p> <p>To kick off the discussion we invited Tudor Fis to tell us about his experience as a freelancer. He has been working since 2009 for various clients in Europe and the US. If you are thinking about freelancing or you are already an experience freelancer we\u2019d love to meet you. It will be an open discussion. Looking forward to your questions!</p> ",

Discuss code you already worked on that you are thinking of making open source</p> <p>2. Discuss ideas of open source projects you would like to contribute to</p> <p>3. Organise your project: code, architecture, comments, issues, PRs, community message.</p> <p>4. Contribute by writing code to one or multiple github repositories.</p> <p>At the end of each event we will take a look at what PRs have been added/merged, see how we can improve our code and share new ideas with the community.</p> <p><b>Requirements:</b></p> <p>\u2022 laptop</p> <p><br/>\u2022 2 hours of your time</p> <p><br/>\u2022 fun learning attitude</p> <p><br/><b>This event is as free as open source.</b></p> ",
