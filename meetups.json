The target audience is SQL developers.</p> <p>We'll start with an overview of Neo4J and its query language Cypher before moving on to a few worked examples where we'll build and query the same data set using first relational databases and then Neo4J.</p> <p>We'll also cover graph modeling, query optimization and show an example of procedures which were introduced in the 3.0 version of Neo4J.</p> <p><b>What is Neo4J?</b></p> <p>Here's a good summary by Emil Eifrem, creator of Neo4J:<br/>Most applications today handle data that is deeply associative, i.e. structured as graphs (networks). The most obvious example of this is social networking sites, but even tagging systems, content management systems and wikis deal with inherently hierarchical or graph-shaped data.<br/>This turns out to be a problem because it\u2019s difficult to deal with recursive data structures in traditional relational databases. In essence, each traversal along a link in a graph is a join, and joins are known to be very expensive. Furthermore, with user-driven content, it is difficult to pre-conceive the exact schema of the data that will be handled. Unfortunately, the relational model requires upfront schemas and makes it difficult to fit this more dynamic and ad-hoc data.<br/>A graph database uses nodes, relationships between nodes and key-value properties instead of tables to represent information. This model is typically substantially faster for associative data sets and uses a schema-less, bottoms-up model that is ideal for capturing ad-hoc and rapidly changing data.</p> ",

        "description": "<p><b>Presentation - Intermediate - Brainstorming your way from a Monolith to a Clean Architecture</b></p> <p>Speaker: <a href=\"http://www.victorrentea.ro\">Victor Rentea</a></p> <p>Did you ever wanted to (re)write your enterprise application from scratch? I\u2019m sure you did ! And I\u2019m pretty sure the rewritten codebase would be two times smaller than it is now. But, given the time and budget for a rewrite, what would you do to keep it from becoming \u201clegacy\u201d again in 2 years?</p> <p><br/>Ok, Wake Up! Your boss won\u2019t approve a rewrite! But still, what should you aim for with your asiduous refactorings and clean-ups?</p> <p><br/>Let me share with you what I believe to be the ideal mindset about an enterprise application:\u00a0Pragmatic, Clean Evolutionary Architecture.</p> <p><br/><b>Pragmatic</b>\u00a0= Keep It Short &amp; Simple</p> <p><b>Clean</b>\u00a0= The Onion Architecture (Dependency Inversion Principle)</p> <p><b>Evolutionary</b>\u00a0= Continuously redesign</p> <p><b>Architecture</b>\u00a0= that will ensure Developer Comfort &amp; Safety.</p> <p><b>Tests, tests, tests</b>\u00a0= Responsible Development</p> <p><br/>It\u2019s all basically a summary of the design principles that we distilled over the past 2 years developing 7 enterprise applications for our client (one of the largest of IBM Romania).</p> <p><b>Agenda</b>:</p> <p>1) Introduction: KISS, DDD vs Transaction Script</p> <p>2) Modeling Data</p> <p>The Fit\u00a0Entity\u00a0that obeys you</p> <p>Value Objects</p> <p>Data Transfer Objects\u00a0that isolate your Entities</p> <p>3) Extracting Logic</p> <p>Mappers\u00a0that encapsulate conversion</p> <p>Facades\u00a0that implement logic</p> <p>Extracting\u00a0Domain Services\u00a0for KISS or DRY</p> <p>Logic Extraction Patterns</p> <p>4) The Clean Architecture</p> <p>Dependency Inversion Principle\u00a0-- the best of OOP (cf. Uncle Bob)</p> <p>Consuming\u00a0Repositories</p> <p>Calling\u00a0External Services</p> <p>5) Testing</p> <p>Principles - Design Feedback</p> <p>Testability</p> <p>A new style of TDD: Extract and Split</p> <p><br/>My goal\u00a0with this talk is basically to open the eyes of enterprise application developers to think critical of the (often) imposed enterprise architecture they follow, and to empower them to\u00a0think out-of-the-box. Hopefully, they will then be able to tackle unexpected functional complexity with an appropriate minimalistic design that would maintain a low design complexity (=less code =happier developers). It's a\u00a0story\u00a0that I've gone through with teams on numerous projects, although I didn't had the chance to talk about it in any public event until now.</p> <p><br/>To keep things simple, the discussion will conceptually start from a simplistic one-class system and grow the architecture with additional patterns, justifying at all times the added complexity with fundamental principles of good design + a lot of discussions. Basically, I would love to hear you continuously arguing with me why I\u2019ve added the complexity as I present it to you. This way, adding constructs as we go, we\u2019ll end up very close to the architectures that we actually use today for our apps at my work.</p> <p><br/>Even though the talk is more on a conceptual level, you\u2019ll see some code examples that support my decisions.</p> <p><br/><b>Target audience:</b> Enterprise application developers (JavaEE, Spring, even non-Java) with at least 3 years of hands-on backend experience.</p> <p><br/>The talk will only address the backend architecture (from the controller to the database).</p> <p><br/><b>References:</b>\u00a0Clean Code\u00a0(Robert C. Martin),\u00a0Rethinking Java EE Patterns\u00a0(Adam Bien), TDD by example (Kent Beck), Extreme Programming Explained (Kent Beck)</p> ",

        "description": "<p>How do you build a transaction monitoring platform which will effectively combat money laundering and terrorist financing? Machine Learning will be at the heart of your solution, but which architecture best fits your needs? In this two part discussion we will answer these questions and offer our advice and anecdotes on navigating the wonderful world of Machine Learning and its practical applications.</p> <p><b>Part 1 - Transaction Monitoring and Money Laundering</b></p> <p>Every day, millions of transactions between people or organisations take place, amongst which there might, just might, be some that are suspicious. Our job is to identify these transactions and why they do not fit a normal pattern. Hence, why we built our transaction monitoring platform.</p> <p>We will be talking about the reasons why this platform needed to be both generic and flexible and\u00a0 how we achieved this. We will go on to discuss:\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Why different clients have different needs depending on the information they choose to\u00a0 store on their transactions.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Why traditional SQL tables are not entirely suited to this application and why NoSQL is a natural alternative, as we still need all the traditional layers of validation and normalisation of external input.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0The challenge of building an engine that is optimised to process large numbers of\u00a0 transactions, whilst at the same time being flexible enough to support all the different styles of analysis that are required to detect money laundering and terrorist financing.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0And in terms of performance how far you can take ORM and when it is acceptable to take\u00a0 matters into your own hands. Finally, we will discuss splitting business logic between Python code and database queries.</p> <p><b>Part 2 - Machine Learning Supermarket Paralysis</b></p> <p>Over the last three years deep learning has exploded in popularity and the quality of the results has greatly improved. Big tech companies have increased their research budgets in order to benefit from this revolution. As a direct consequence several of these (Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon) have released open frameworks for training and developing deep architectures such as: TensorFlow, CNTK, FBLearner, MxNET and Caffe.</p> <p>Beside these, other popular existing frameworks and wrappers coming mainly from academia, have gathered a great deal of support (Theano, Torch7, Scikit-learn, Keras).</p> <p>With such a broad choice, it's no surprise that choosing the \"right\" Machine Learning (ML)\u00a0 framework can lead to a paradox of choice (especially for beginner ML students). This talk will give an overview of what ML frameworks are and what they do. We will discuss in more detail TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Theano and Keras, highlighting the pros and cons for each of these frameworks. Finally, we will demonstrate them by applying them to a simple linear regression task.</p> <p><b>Persic Alexandru Cristian (Backend Lead)</b>\u00a0studied Computer Science at \"Stefan cel Mare\" University, followed by a Master\u2019s degree in software engineering (apparently 5 years of\u00a0 study was not good enough). At university he started working at an outsource company using Microsoft technologies and enjoyed each step from helping with JavaScript to implementing custom workflows in SharePoint. After 5 years he saw the light and moved to Python/Django, building a mobile advertising platform from the ground up. In 4 years he managed to gain plenty of experience in managing the implementation, deployment and maintenance of a large scale web application. In 2016 Cristi made a daring move and joined\u00a0<a href=\"https://complyadvantage.com\">ComplyAdvantage\u00a0</a>in the quest of finding once more the excitement of building a new and successful product, all the while fighting crime like any other regular superhero.</p> <p><b>Ariel Pontes (Python Engineer)</b>\u00a0studied Computer Engineering at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. After learning Python/Django in his first internship in a fin tech startup he fell in love with MVC frameworks, and re-wrote his final year project in Ruby on Rails. In 2014 he moved to Cluj and started working as a full-stack Django developer in a big outsourcing company. Ariel joined\u00a0<a href=\"https://complyadvantage.com\">ComplyAdvantage\u00a0</a>in 2016 where he works on the transaction monitoring and screening platforms. Outside of work you can find him participating in activism for local NGOs and preaching about secular ethics.</p> <p><b>Oana Ratiu (Python Engineer)</b>\u00a0graduated from Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, studying computer science, and is currently completing her Master's Degree in Databases. She has worked as a programmer for three years, mostly with Python. Excited to fight terrorism through her work, Oana joined\u00a0<a href=\"https://complyadvantage.com/\">ComplyAdvantage</a>\u00a0in early 2016, working on a transaction monitoring platform and, more recently, on a screening platform.</p> <p><b>Cristian Lungu (Senior Python/ML Engineer)</b>\u00a0wrote (anti)viruses for fun and profit for 5 years until he realised how much money flows through the stock market. He then spent his next 5 years coding derivatives, futures and options. Somehow, he was kidnapped and dropped on this startup ship called\u00a0<a href=\"https://complyadvantage.com/\">ComplyAdvantage</a>\u00a0where fighting terrorists and money laundering with machine learning is the only way to get a meal. As a result of this event, he challenged himself to actually finish his lifelong hobby, a PhD in machine learning, this century. When he doesn't code he's probably teaching bubble sort at the UTCN or\u00a0 conducting practical studies of gradient descent on some mountains.</p> <p><b>Schedule:\u00a0</b></p> <p>18:00 - 18:15 - Arrival time.

How to choose a theme\u00a0</b></p> <p>We'll be discussing how we evaluate a theme, try to put together a list of useful suggestions for anyone looking to setup a new WordPress site.</p> <p><b>2. Our go-to Plugins</b></p> <p>We'll take turns discussing about the plugins we use most often. What do they do, what alternatives are there, who uses what.</p> <p>We've pushed back the date in hopes that we'll be able to find someone to give us a talk about developing themes for selling them on ThemeForest. Unfortunately we haven't managed to find anyone yet.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>So this is also an open call for all you theme developers out there - if you wanna give a talk in the Cluj Meetup, please contact us. (We can also, if you're unable to visit our wonderful city, do this online on skype , hangouts, or you name it).</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you all!</p> ",

Where we don\u2019t just offer a single monolithic platform, we offer a multidimensional approach where users can pick and choose the workflows and micro apps of their choice.</p> <p>A similar trend is also happening in software development, where microservices are now the mainstream approach for scalable systems architecture. Many software engineers are making the transition from monolithic architectures to microservice architectures. This approach has until most recently been limited to back-end services. As development is much more complicated when using microservices as building blocks for a frontend solutions, especially with the latest JS frameworks that promote a\u00a0monolithic approach to front-end architecture.</p> <p>We will give an overview of the theory of microservices \u2013 what they are and why you would use them. We will then delve into the dark arts of back-end development, explaining how you can construct a winning product with microservices whilst avoiding its pitfalls. We will also discuss methods of rolling your own Frontend app in a world of backend microservices and tackling the challenges of monolithic frontend apps when working with microservices as backend.<br/>\u00a0\nThe presentation will cover:</p> <p>\u2022 Background on what microservices are and why you would use them</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A walk through of a backend application development and architecture using microservices to compare and contrast\u00a0 traditional architectural methodologies</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0A discuss on the ways of rolling your own frontend app in a world of backend microservices and ways of tackling challenges of having a monolithic frontend app working with microservices as backend</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, no discussion of microservices would be complete without touching on the integration of Docker and Kubernetes from a developer\u2019s perspective<br/>\u00a0</p> <p><b>Speakers:</b></p> <p><b>Oliver Butterfield (Platform Lead)</b> is <a href=\"https://complyadvantage.com/\">ComplyAdvantage\u2019</a>s primary driving towards adopting a microservice architecture. Oliver previously worked in the server hosting industry and as one of the first team members became the de facto DevOps Engineer in the early days of ComplyAdvantage. Fast forward three years and he's now overseeing development of our client-facing services, including the refactoring of the core application from a monolith to microservices. Oliver is currently excited by distributed computing and performance technologies, such as Kubernetes, AWS, NewRelic and Go.</p> <p><b>Persic Alexandru Cristian (Backend Lead)</b> studied computer science at \"Stefan cel Mare\" University, followed by a masters degree in software engineering (apparently 5 years of study was not good enough). At University he started working at an outsource company using Microsoft technologies and enjoyed each step from helping with JavaScript to implementing custom workflows in SharePoint. After 5 years he saw the light and moved to Python/Django, building a mobile advertising platform from the ground up. In 4 years he managed to gain plenty of experience in managing the implementation, deployment, and maintenance of a large scale web application. In 2016 Cristi made a daring move and joined <a href=\"https://complyadvantage.com/\">ComplyAdvantage</a> in the quest of finding once more the excitement of building a new and successful product, all the while fighting crime like any other regular superhero.<br/>\u00a0\n<b>Kun Andrei (FrontEnd Lead)</b> graduated from Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, studying Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology. Since then he's been working as a Web Developer on both backend and frontend, though finally focussing on the latter. He followed his passion for UI and the latest frontend technologies. After he gained experience with various corporations and outsourcing companies he was lured by the opportunities of a young and ambitious startup team where he could take ownership of his work and put his own mark on products. Joining <a href=\"https://complyadvantage.com/\">ComplyAdvantage</a> was the right step in this direction, he now takes care of the company's front-end apps.<br/>\u00a0\n<b>Andrew Smith (DevOps Lead)</b> studied Mathematics at Warwick University (UK). Graduating in 2012 with no idea what he wanted to do as a career, he fell into a Release Engineering Role at a London FinTech company. Three years later, in January 2016, he joined <a href=\"https://complyadvantage.com/\">ComplyAdvantage</a> as their first DevOps Engineer (a far more morally fulfilling role). He has implemented technology, infrastructure, and procedures to effectively and reliably go \"From Idea to Production\" (to quote GitLab) and to keep everything highly available once it's there. Outside of work, you'll most likely find him at the nearest venue playing loud music, performing culinary experimentation or creating fine works of art in MS Paint.</p> <p><b>Schedule:\u00a0</b></p> <p>18:00 - 18:15 - Arrival time.

        "description": "<p><b>Hunting Money Launderers in Machine Learning Supermarkets</b></p> <p>How do you build a transaction monitoring platform which will effectively combat money laundering and terrorist financing? Machine Learning will be at the heart of your solution, but which architecture best fits your needs? In this two part discussion we will answer these questions and offer our advice and anecdotes on navigating the wonderful world of Machine Learning and its practical applications.</p> <p><b>Part 1 - Transaction Monitoring and Money Laundering </b></p> <p>Every day, millions of transactions between people or organizations take place, amongst which there might, just might, be some that are suspicious. Our job is to identify these transactions and why they do not fit a normal pattern. Hence, why we built our transaction monitoring platform.</p> <p>We will be talking about the reasons why this platform needed to be both generic and flexible and\u00a0 how we achieved this. We will go on to discuss:\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022 Why different clients have different needs depending on the information they choose to\u00a0 store on their transactions.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Why traditional SQL tables are not entirely suited to this application and why NoSQL is a natural alternative, as we still need all the traditional layers of validation and normalization of external input.</p> <p>\u2022 The challenge of building an engine that is optimised to process large numbers of\u00a0 transactions, whilst at the same time being flexible enough to support all the different styles of analysis that are required to detect money laundering and terrorist financing.</p> <p>\u2022 And in terms of performance how far you can take ORM and when it is acceptable to take\u00a0 matters into your own hands. Finally, we will discuss splitting business logic between Python code and database queries.</p> <p><b>Part 2 - Machine Learning Supermarket Paralysis</b></p> <p>Over the last three years deep learning has exploded in popularity and the quality of the results has greatly improved. Big tech companies have increased their research budgets in order to benefit from this revolution. As a direct consequence several of these (Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon) have released open frameworks for training and developing deep architectures such as: TensorFlow, CNTK, FBLearner, MxNET and Caffe.</p> <p>Beside these, other popular existing frameworks and wrappers coming mainly from academia, have gathered a great deal of support (Theano, Torch7, Scikit-learn, Keras).</p> <p>With such a broad choice, it's no surprise that choosing the \"right\" Machine Learning (ML)\u00a0 framework can lead to a paradox of choice (especially for beginner ML students). This talk will give an overview of what ML frameworks are and what they do. We will discuss in more detail TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Theano and Keras, highlighting the pros and cons for each of these frameworks. Finally, we will demonstrate them by applying them to a simple linear regression task.</p> <p><b>Persic Alexandru Cristian (Backend Lead)</b> studied Computer Science at \"Stefan cel Mare\" University, followed by a Master\u2019s degree in software engineering (apparently 5 years of\u00a0 study was not good enough).

Ariel joined <a href=\"https://complyadvantage.com/\">ComplyAdvantage</a> in 2016 where he works on the transaction monitoring and screening platforms. Outside of work you can find him participating in activism for local NGOs and preaching about secular ethics.</p> <p><b>Oana Ratiu (Python Engineer)</b> graduated from Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, studying computer science, and is currently completing her Master's Degree in Databases. She has worked as a programmer for three years, mostly with Python.

The others are in the room, watching the code changes.<br/>\u2022 Every 7 minutes, one developer leaves the laptop and the next one from the room takes his place.<br/>\u2022 After a specified period of time (usually around two hours), the dojo ends with a retrospective.</p> ",

Some of these are true, but freelancers also deal with risk, late payments, difficult clients, uncomfortable timezones, distributed teams and more. It takes discipline, very good communication skills, some sales &amp; marketing techniques and top notch technical know-how to make it as a successful freelancer.</p> <p>To kick off the discussion we invited Tudor Fis to tell us about his experience as a freelancer. He has been working since 2009 for various clients in Europe and the US. If you are thinking about freelancing or you are already an experience freelancer we\u2019d love to meet you.

It takes discipline, very good communication skills, some sales &amp; marketing techniques and top notch technical know-how to make it as a successful freelancer.</p> <p>To kick off the discussion we invited Tudor Fis to tell us about his experience as a freelancer. He has been working since 2009 for various clients in Europe and the US. If you are thinking about freelancing or you are already an experience freelancer we\u2019d love to meet you.
